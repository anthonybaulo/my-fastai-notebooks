    "Jeremy's explanation:<br>\n",
    "So currently, to get a fast matrix multiply, things like PyTorch, they don't even write it themselves, they push it off to something called a blas. BLAS is a basic linear algebra subprogams library, where companies like Intel and AMD and Nvidia, write these things for you. So you can look up somethign like cuBLAS, this is like Nvidias version of BLAS. Or you can look up MKL, and this is like Intels version of BLAS. And this is kind of awful, because the programmer is limited to this subset of things that your BLAS can handle. And to use it you don't really get to write it in Python. You kind of have to write the one thing that happens to be turned into that existing BLAS call. So this is why we need to do better. And there are people working on this, and there are people actually in Chris Lattner's team working on this. There's really cool stuff, something called tensor comprehensions, which is origanlly came in PyTorch and I think they now are inside Chris' team in Google, where people are basically saying: here are ways to compile these much more general things. And this is what we want as more advance practitioners."
